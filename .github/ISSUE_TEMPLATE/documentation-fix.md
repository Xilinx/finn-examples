## Prerequisites
Please make sure to check that your suggested documentation fix is not already being worked on, by checking the open issues. You can also check to see if it's fixed on the most recent version of the `/dev` branch.

Even if an idea is already being worked on you can still create an documentation fix request,
if you would like to open a discussion about the documentation, or want to contribute to it.

## Details
Please add to the following sections to describe the fix as accurately as possible.

### Suggested change(s)
